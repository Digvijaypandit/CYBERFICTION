CYBERFICTION
A Sci-Fi-Themed Interactive Web Experience
CYBERFICTION is a front-end project that creates a futuristic, cinematic experience where images change smoothly like a video as you scroll. 
The project leverages HTML5 Canvas and Locomotive Scroll to achieve smooth, performant animations based on user scroll interactions.

Features
Scroll-Based Animation with Locomotive Scroll: Using Locomotive Scroll for smooth, hardware-accelerated scrolling and image transitions.
Canvas Element: Dynamic image rendering on an HTML5 <canvas> element for efficient frame-by-frame transitions.
Cyberpunk Theme: A visually immersive sci-fi experience inspired by the cyberpunk genre.
Performance Optimized: Preloading images and optimizing rendering for a seamless user experience.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technologies Used
HTML5 Canvas: For rendering and drawing images as the user scrolls.
Locomotive Scroll: A smooth scrolling library that powers the scroll-triggered animations.
CSS3: To ensure smooth transitions and style the page with a futuristic aesthetic.
JavaScript: For handling scroll events, drawing images onto the canvas, and interacting with Locomotive Scroll.

How It Works
Locomotive Scroll Integration : Locomotive Scroll is used to enhance the scrolling experience, providing smooth, inertial scrolling with built-in performance optimizations.
It detects scroll events and triggers the loading of new images in sync with the user's scroll position.
Canvas Rendering : Images are dynamically drawn onto the <canvas> element based on the current scroll position, simulating the effect of a video playing.
Preloaded image sequences are displayed as frames to give the appearance of smooth motion.
Scroll-Based Animation : As users scroll up or down, Locomotive Scroll provides a fluid motion, while JavaScript updates the canvas to show different frames of the animation.
